# Installation

`npm install`

# Call a REST API

Put all of your code in the `app.component`. Don't worry about making any optimizations or even doing this the "right" way! Simply calling a REST API and display the data you get back in the template is enough to consider this a win.

# See if it's working

`npm run start -- -o` The `-o` will tell the CLI to open the browser after finishing initial compilation.
