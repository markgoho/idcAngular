{{ data | json }}

<!-- If you've chosen an api that nests the data it returns, you may want to
access those nested properties with `.` notation.app-root

For example:

{
  "value": {
    "name": "Frank"
  }
}

...would be accessed as `data.value.name`. But you might get an error in the console
by doing exactly this, so try using this syntax: `data?.value?.name` -->
